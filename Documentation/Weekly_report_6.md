# Week 6

- [Hours](https://github.com/ArttuLe/k-nn-image-classification/blob/main/Documentation/Hours.md)

## Weekly report no. 6

### Things that i've done this week
- Mostly been running tests on the accuracy testing app as I've been sick most of the week, so that was something I still managed to do.


### Progression
- Everything is mostly done, all that remains is further improvement on the computation efficiency, so I can run tests on bigger sets of data.


### Next up...
- More tests, incrementally bigger datasets.
- Improve the computation with a goal of running the tests on the whole dataset in a reasonable time.
- Check the documentation and the code and make sure everything is fine.


### Questions
- The latest test ran for 23 hours with 15000/1200 data. What would be a realistic goal for the time of running the tests on the whole dataset with an efficient algorithm/computation? It is clear that more optimization is needed.
