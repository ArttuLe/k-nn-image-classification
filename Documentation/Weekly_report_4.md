# Week 4

- [Hours](https://github.com/ArttuLe/k-nn-image-classification/blob/main/Documentation/Hours.md)

## Weekly report no. 3

### Things that i've done this week
- Finished up the GUI and its now working as intended.
- Did some testing on different k values with a small train set.


### Progression
- Application is progressing well, gui is done, so i can now focus solely on optimizing the algorithm and testing with bigger sets.

### What i've learned so far


### Next up...
- More tests
- Optimize the computing in order to test the different parameters more efficiently.


### Questions
- Should i try using threads for more efficient computing or simply try to optimize the algorithm?
