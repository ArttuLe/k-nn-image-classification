## Unit Testing




### Distance metrics



### K-NN algorithm


### Manual accuracy testing

Manual accuracy testing needs to be run in order to validate the accuracy of the algorithm



Below are accuracy tests with different sized training sets and testing sets.


Train set  | test set| K-value | Accuracy |
-----------|---------|---------|----------|
10000      | 500     |  3      |    96 %  |
