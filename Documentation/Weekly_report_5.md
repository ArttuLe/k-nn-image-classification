# Week 5

- [Hours](https://github.com/ArttuLe/k-nn-image-classification/blob/main/Documentation/Hours.md)

## Weekly report no. 5

### Things that i've done this week
- Optimized the distance calculations by checking the surrounding pixels before looping over the whole image.
- Implemented multiprocessing for the accuracy testing, huge improvement in computation.


### Progression
- Application is coming along nicely,


### Next up...
- More tests, incrementally bigger datasets.
- There might be some room for improvement when it comes to the computing.


### Questions
- Now that the algorithm is running more efficiently should I test the k-values again with bigger datasets too?
